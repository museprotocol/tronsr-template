Muse Protocol is a hybrid-based Blockstack (STX) and Tron (TRC-20) digital ecosystem built on a set of automatic, pre-arranged agreements, called smart contracts, that allows for the trust free management of profit generated by music and the transformation of fanbases into their own symbiotic economies. Muse is a decentralized social streaming platform that favors artists and creatives while rewarding participants for engagement and consumption. It serves as an innovative social decentralized application that allows for much more than your average streaming application. This includes a combination of social streaming, playlist creation, bounty interaction, and much much more. Muse is as a truly decentralized take at border less media sharing and artist connection.
